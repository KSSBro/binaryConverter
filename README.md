#### Encoding ASCII text

Use the command **encode** to encode ASCII text.

Options:

- `-filepath`: path to the file with the text in it 
- `-text`: text to encode if it's not in a file
- `-form`: the format you want to encode the text in (decimal | binary | octal | hecadecimal | base64)
- `-delimiter`: the delimiter you want to use in the encoded text, space is default
- `--createfile`: true: will create a text file with the encoded text, false(defult): won't create a file

```bash
codec encode -text *ascii_text* -form *format* --createfile *true/false*
```

#### Decoding encoded text

Use the command **decode** to decode encoded text.

Options:

- `-filepath`: path to the file with the encoded text in it 
- `-text`: text to decode if it's not in a file
- `-form`: the format of the encoded text (decimal | binary | octal | hecadecimal | base64)
- `-delimiter`: the delimiter used in the encoded text, space is default
- `--createfile`: true: will create a text file with the decoded text, false(defult): won't create a file
